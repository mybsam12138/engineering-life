# Resume Writing Guide for IT Developers

> **Target audience**: All IT developers, especially **Java backend engineers** (junior → senior → architect)
>
> This guide is **role-focused**, not person-specific.

## 1. What a Resume Is (For IT Developers)

For an IT developer, a resume is **not**:
- a list of technologies you once touched
- a dump of every project you joined
- a copy of your job description

A resume **is**:

> A technical & professional summary that convinces the reader:
> **“This developer can build, maintain, and evolve our system.”**

Hiring managers care about:
- problem‑solving ability
- system thinking
- code quality & maintainability
- real production experience

---

## 2. How IT Resumes Are Actually Read

Most resumes are scanned in this order:

1. **Professional Summary** (10–20 seconds)
2. **Recent Work Experience** (titles + keywords)
3. **Project bullets** (depth & thinking)
4. **Skills section** (confirmation, not discovery)

> If your value is not obvious in **30 seconds**, the resume fails.

---

## 3. Recommended Resume Structure (1–2 Pages)

```
1. Header (Basic info)
2. Professional Summary
3. Technical Skills (grouped)
4. Work Experience
5. Key Projects
6. Education
7. Optional: Open Source / Blog / Certifications
```

---

## 4. Header (Keep It Professional)

**Include**
```
Name | Java Backend Engineer
City | Years of experience
Email | Phone | GitHub (strongly recommended)
```

**Do NOT include**
- ID number
- age / gender / marital status
- unrelated links

---

## 5. Professional Summary (Most Important Section)

### Purpose

To quickly answer:
- What level developer are you?
- What stack do you specialize in?
- What kind of systems have you built?

### Good Summary Example (Generic)

> Java backend engineer with experience building **Spring Boot–based systems**, familiar with REST API design, database modeling, and common middleware. Has participated in production systems involving high concurrency, data consistency, and long-term maintainability.

### Bad Summary Example

> Familiar with Java, Spring, MySQL, hardworking and responsible.

---

## 6. Technical Skills (Grouped, Not a Keyword Dump)

### Backend
- Java 8–21, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring AOP
- RESTful API design, validation, exception handling

### Persistence & Data
- MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle
- MyBatis / JPA / Hibernate
- Transaction management

### Infrastructure & Middleware
- Docker, Linux basics
- Redis, MQ (Kafka / RabbitMQ)

### Engineering Fundamentals
- JVM basics (GC, memory, encoding, timezone)
- Logging, monitoring, debugging

> Skills are **proof support**, not the proof itself.

---

## 7. Work Experience (The Core Section)

### Golden Rule

Each bullet should answer:

```
What problem did you solve, how, and why it mattered?
```

### Weak Bullet (Avoid)
- Developed backend APIs using Spring Boot.

### Strong Bullet (Generic but Good)
- Designed and implemented backend APIs for a business system using Spring Boot, focusing on clear domain modeling, validation, and maintainability.

- Participated in database schema design and optimized SQL queries to improve system stability under increasing data volume.

### Tips
- 4–6 bullets per role
- Emphasize **design decisions**, not just implementation
- Avoid listing frameworks already shown in skills

---

## 8. Project Experience (Very Important for Java Developers)

Projects show **how you think**, not just where you worked.

### What Interviewers Look For
- system boundaries
- data flow
- trade-offs
- long-term thinking

### Good Project Description Structure

```
Project background (what problem it solves)
Your responsibility
Key technical decisions
Result / impact
```

### Example

- Built a backend service for managing business data using Spring Boot.
- Designed unified API response and error handling to improve consistency across modules.
- Ensured system extensibility for future requirements.

---

## 9. Education (Simple & Honest)

```
Degree – Major
University
```

- GPA only if strong
- No need for course lists

---

## 10. Optional but High-Value Sections

### Open Source / Technical Writing

- GitHub repositories
- Technical blogs
- Architecture or framework documentation

> These strongly signal **senior potential**.

### Certifications (Optional)

- Java / Cloud / Database certifications (only if relevant)

---

## 11. Common Mistakes in IT Resumes

❌ Listing too many technologies without context  
❌ Writing like a job description  
❌ Overusing buzzwords ("high performance", "high availability") without explanation  
❌ Dense paragraphs, no white space  
❌ More than 2 pages for <10 years experience

---

## 12. Formatting Rules (Technical Resumes)

- 1–2 pages maximum
- Clear section titles
- Bullet points, not paragraphs
- Consistent tense
- Simple font (no design-heavy templates)

---

## 13. Final Resume Checklist

Before sending, ask:

- Can a tech lead tell my **level** in 20 seconds?
- Does this show **how I solve problems**?
- Are my strongest experiences **immediately visible**?

If yes → ready to apply.

---

## 14. How to Use This Guide

1. Draft your resume following this structure
2. Remove anything not helping interviews
3. Adjust wording for each job description

---

> A good IT resume shows **thinking clarity**, not just technical breadth.
