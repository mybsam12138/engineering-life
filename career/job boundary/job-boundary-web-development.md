# Job Boundary in Web Development Company

## 1. What is Job Boundary?

Job boundary defines:

-   Scope of responsibility
-   Decision authority
-   Collaboration interface
-   Ownership level
-   Accountability scope

Without clear boundaries:

-   Work overlaps
-   Blame shifting happens
-   Technical debt grows
-   Responsibility becomes vague

Clear boundaries improve efficiency and reduce organizational friction.

# 2. Common Roles in Web Development

## 2.1 Product Manager (PM)

**Responsible for:**

-   Business requirements
-   Feature definition
-   Requirement documentation
-   Prioritization
-   Stakeholder communication

**Not responsible for:**

-   Technical implementation details
-   Code quality
-   Infrastructure design

Boundary principle:

> PM defines "WHAT"\
> Engineers decide "HOW"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   UI implementation
-   State management
-   API integration
-   Browser performance
-   Client-side error handling

# 3. Horizontal vs Vertical Boundaries

## Horizontal Boundary

Between different roles at the same project level.

Example:

Frontend ↔ Backend\
Backend ↔ DevOps\
PM ↔ Engineering

## Vertical Boundary

Between seniority levels.

Example:

Junior Engineer → Implementation\
Senior Engineer → Design decisions\
Tech Lead → Architecture ownership\
CTO → Technology strategy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Decision Authority Levels

  Level                    Responsibility
  ------------------------ ---------------------
  Individual Contributor   Implement tasks
  Senior Engineer          Technical design
  Tech Lead                System architecture
  Engineering Manager      Team coordination
  CTO                      Technology strategy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Common Boundary Problems

1.  Undefined API contracts\
2.  PM micromanaging implementation\
3.  Engineers making business decisions\
4.  DevOps blamed for code issues\
5.  No clear ownership of bugs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Boundary in Modern Web Architecture

In modern systems:

-   Microservices create service-level boundaries
-   API contracts define communication boundaries
-   Code ownership defines team boundaries
-   Git repository structure reflects architecture boundary

Clear boundaries reduce chaos in scaling teams.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Career Insight

Understanding job boundaries helps you:

-   Avoid role confusion
-   Communicate clearly
-   Know when to escalate
-   Grow from executor to decision maker

Boundary awareness is a key trait of senior engineers.
