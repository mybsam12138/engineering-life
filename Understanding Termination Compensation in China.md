## Why I Wrote This

In China, many employees hear that *illegal termination leads to 2N compensation*, yet only a small number of people actually receive it.  
The gap between **what the law says** and **what happens in practice** usually comes from misunderstanding termination types, procedures, and evidence requirements.

This article explains **N, N+1, and 2N** in a clear, practical way—especially for engineers and office workers.

## Key Concept: What Is “N”?

**N** represents your **years of service**, calculated by law (not simply calendar years).

Common practice:
- Less than 6 months → **0.5 year**
- 6 months to < 12 months → **1 year**
- Each full year → **1 year**

Example:
- 13 months of service → **N = 1.5**

---

## What Is the Salary Base?

Compensation is calculated using your **average monthly salary in the 12 months before termination**.

This usually includes:
- Base salary  
- Regular bonuses  
- Allowances and subsidies  

It usually excludes:
- One-time gifts  
- Expense reimbursements  

The law focuses on **actual income**, not just what is written in the contract.

## N Compensation (Legal Termination)

### When it applies
- Contract expires and the employer chooses not to renew  
- Legal redundancy or position cancellation  
- Other lawful termination scenarios  

### Formula
```
Compensation = N × average monthly salary
```

This is the **minimum statutory compensation** in lawful terminations.

---

## N+1 Compensation (No Notice)

### What “no notice” means
The employer:
- Did **not** give 30 days’ written notice **and**
- Did **not** continue employment for those 30 days

In this case, the employer must pay **one additional month of salary**.

### Formula
```
Compensation = (N + 1) × average monthly salary
```

This is why many companies offer **N+1**—it is cheaper than 2N but safer than risking illegality.

---

## 2N Compensation (Illegal Termination)

### When it applies
2N applies **only if all of the following are true**:
- The employer unilaterally terminates the employee
- The termination lacks legal grounds
- Required procedures are not followed
- The employee did **not** agree to termination

### Formula
```
Compensation = 2 × N × average monthly salary
```

2N is **punitive compensation**, so courts and arbitration committees apply it **strictly**.

---

## Why Most People Don’t Get 2N

Common reasons:
1. The employee signs a **mutual termination agreement**
2. Lack of written evidence
3. Termination is disguised as “performance issues” or “restructuring”
4. The employee accepts settlement early
5. The cost and stress of arbitration or litigation

Once a **mutual agreement** is signed, 2N is usually no longer available.

---

## The “Mutual Agreement” Trap

Mutual termination agreements often include clauses like:
- “Both parties agree to terminate”
- “No further disputes remain”

Once signed:
- The termination is no longer considered unilateral
- Claims for illegal termination become very difficult

This is the **most common reason** employees lose 2N protection.

---

## Practical Advice

If you ever face termination:
- Do **not** sign immediately
- Ask for the **legal basis** of termination
- Request **30 days’ written notice** or payment in lieu
- Save emails, chat records, and salary proof

A calm response and basic legal awareness can significantly affect outcomes.

## Final Thoughts

Understanding **N, N+1, and 2N** is not about fighting every employer—it’s about **knowing your baseline rights**.  
Clear knowledge reduces fear, improves negotiation outcomes, and helps you make informed decisions during stressful moments.

*Knowledge of workplace rules is part of professional maturity—not conflict.*
