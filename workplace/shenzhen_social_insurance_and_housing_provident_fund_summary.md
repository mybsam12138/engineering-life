# Shenzhen Social Insurance & Housing Provident Fund (HPF) – Practical Summary

> **Location**: Shenzhen, China  
> **Purpose**: Clear, practical explanation of **functions, contribution rules, calculation methods, and retroactive recovery paths** for Social Insurance and Housing Provident Fund (HPF).

---

## 1. Social Insurance (Social Security)

### 1.1 Overview

Social Insurance for urban employees in Shenzhen is **mandatory by law** and consists of **five insurances**:

- Pension Insurance
- Medical Insurance
- Unemployment Insurance
- Work Injury Insurance
- Maternity Insurance

Employers must register employees and contribute based on the employee’s **actual monthly wage**, within statutory caps.

---

### 1.2 Core Functions

| Insurance | Primary Function |
|---------|------------------|
| Pension | Lifetime monthly pension after retirement (eligibility + formula based) |
| Medical | Reimbursement for outpatient, hospitalization, and major illness |
| Unemployment | Temporary income support after involuntary unemployment |
| Work Injury | Compensation for work-related injury or disability |
| Maternity | Coverage for childbirth-related medical costs and leave |

**Key concept**: Social Insurance is primarily a **legal entitlement and risk-sharing system**, not a personal investment product.

---

### 1.3 Contribution Split (Employee vs Employer)

> Percentages below reflect **typical Shenzhen practice** (policy may adjust slightly over time).

| Item | Employee | Employer | Notes |
|----|---------|----------|------|
| Pension | ~8% | ~14–16% | Employee part goes to personal account; employer part to social pooling |
| Medical | ~2% | ~6% | Mainly pooled; minor fixed fee may apply |
| Unemployment | ~0.5% | ~0.5–1% | Low impact |
| Work Injury | 0% | Industry-based | Employer only |
| Maternity | 0% | ~0.45–1% | Employer only |

---

### 1.4 Contribution Base (Salary Base)

- **Standard base**: employee’s actual monthly wage
- **Lower cap**: statutory minimum base
- **Upper cap**: statutory maximum base (multiple of local average wage)

Incorrect practices include:
- Under-reporting salary base
- Paying at minimum base despite higher actual income

---

### 1.5 Pension Calculation (Simplified)

Monthly pension = **Basic Pension + Personal Account Pension**

**Basic Pension** depends on:
- Local average wage at retirement
- Individual average contribution wage
- Total contribution years

**Personal Account Pension**:

```
Personal Account Balance ÷ Government-defined payout months
```

Higher contribution base and longer contribution years increase lifetime pension.

---

### 1.6 Retroactive Recovery (Back Payment) – Shenzhen Practice

**Nature**: Administrative enforcement (not necessarily labor arbitration)

**Authority**:
- Shenzhen Municipal Social Insurance Fund Administration

**When applicable**:
- Employer underpaid or underreported contribution base
- Employer failed to register employee

**Process**:
1. Employee submits materials (labor relationship proof + wage evidence)
2. Social Insurance authority investigates
3. Employer is ordered to pay outstanding contributions
4. Arbitration is required only if labor relationship is disputed

**Key point**: Social Insurance recovery is an **administrative correction**, not a private negotiation.

---

## 2. Housing Provident Fund (HPF)

### 2.1 Overview

Housing Provident Fund is a **mandatory savings system** designed to support housing-related expenses. Unlike Social Insurance, **all funds belong to the employee**.

---

### 2.2 Core Functions

- Home purchase down payment
- Mortgage repayment
- Rental expense support (policy-based)
- Long-term housing savings

**Key concept**: HPF is a **forced savings account**, not a risk-pooling system.

---

### 2.3 Contribution Split

| Party | Typical Rate |
|-----|-------------|
| Employee | 5%–12% |
| Employer | 5%–12% |

> Employee and employer must use the **same rate**.

---

### 2.4 HPF Contribution Base Types

Shenzhen typically recognizes **three practical base approaches**:

1. **Actual Wage Base**  
   - Based on real monthly salary  
   - Fully compliant and recommended

2. **Minimum Base**  
   - Based on statutory minimum wage base  
   - Common but often non-compliant if salary is higher

3. **Capped Base**  
   - Based on statutory maximum base  
   - Used for high-income employees

---

### 2.5 HPF Calculation Example

If:
- Actual wage = 25,000
- Reported base = 7,000
- Contribution rate = 12%

**Monthly gap**:

```
(25,000 − 7,000) × 12% = 2,160
```

- Employee retroactive amount: 2,160 / month
- Employer retroactive amount: 2,160 / month

---

### 2.6 Retroactive Recovery – HPF

**Authority**:
- Shenzhen Housing Provident Fund Management Center

**Process**:
1. Employee files complaint / request
2. Authority verifies wage and labor relationship
3. Employer is ordered to make retroactive payments

HPF recovery is typically **faster and more straightforward** than Social Insurance.

---

## 3. Practical Comparison

| Dimension | Social Insurance | Housing Provident Fund |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| Nature | Risk-sharing & eligibility | Forced personal savings |
| Ownership | Mostly pooled | Fully employee-owned |
| Liquidity | Very low | Medium (policy-limited) |
| Investment logic | Not return-driven | Capital-preserving |
| Retroactive recovery | Administrative enforcement | Administrative enforcement |

---

## 4. Strategic Takeaway

- **Social Insurance**: Secure eligibility and minimum compliance; focus on contribution years and continuity.
- **HPF**: Ensure correct base and rate; it is the most deterministic and controllable benefit.

> A rational strategy is to treat Social Insurance as **system access**, and HPF as **personal asset accumulation**.
